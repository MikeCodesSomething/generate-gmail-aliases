    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>Enter a gmail address in the box above (including @gmail.com) and click 'Generate', this will produce 5 aliases for that email address by randomly placing periods in there before the @. Keep pressing the button to get more aliases</p>
    <h3>When is this useful?</h3>
    <p>This is useful any time you need a 'unique' email, but don't want to create a whole new email address, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing - need 100 fresh emails to test the new account creation journey on your app? Use some of these and save yourself creating 99 actual email addresses.</li>
        <li>Security - if you use an alias of an email for a service that is then hacked, that email won't be the same email you've used for other services, making it harder to hack you.</li>
        <li>Privacy - using different emails make you harder to track.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FAQs</h3>
    <p class="Question">Q - Can I switch between 'googlemail.com' and 'gmail.com' to create an Alias?</p>
    <p class="Answer">A - Yep, this gives you one alias, you can combine this with periods to effectively double your options. I might add this to the generator at some point</p>
    <p class="Question">Q - Can't I just use a + and then add any text I like?</p>
    <p class="Answer">A - Sometimes! This is easy to do, for example myemail+1@gmail.com myemail+2@gmail.com etc, but I have found that '+' is often not an allowed character in email signup forms, whereas '.' always is. Consecutive '.'s I don't think always work, so tend to stick to one '.'</p>
    <p class="Question">Q - Are these alias' always unique?</p>
    <p class="Answer">A - No, they're always random, but there is a chance of getting one you've had before (the longer the email the lower the chance)</p>
