# generate-gmail-aliases
Use this to create multiple equivalent email addresses. Specific to gmail as they treat emails that are identical but have periods anywhere in the address (before the @) as the same email address.

# Usage
1. Navigate to the index webpage (main branch hosted on github pages here: https://mikecodessomething.github.io/generate-gmail-aliases )
2. Follow page instructions to generate gmail aliases
3. Copy the gmail alias to use as required

# To-do
- Add a way for the user to specify how many alises are required
- Add a way to randomise gmail/googlemail to double the potential number of alises
- Autofill the gmail part of the email address
- Prevent duplicate aliases from appearing (realistically only in one generation)
- Apply some styling
